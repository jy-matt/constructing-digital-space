						"It is likely that in the near future, a large number of people will be spending a
						considerable amount of time 'inside' such worlds. If we are to live - even partially - 'inside'
						these worlds, we must consider their architecture. The nature of space in VEs, however, is
						fundamentally different from the
						nature of real space and consequently the architecture of VEs will require a new theory and
						practice." - Bourdakis & Charitos, 1999

					<h2>CONCEPT</h2>

					<h3>Architecture and Virtual Environments</h3>
					<p>
						Despite the fact that virtual environments (VEs) have been around for more than 20 years and
						there has been continued research into their design and implementation, they have been regarded
						largely as entertainment and as
						<b>accessories to physical interaction</b>. In the midst of the post-digital revolution and the ongoing
						pandemic, we are increasingly looking at VEs as <b>substitutes</b> for real-life interaction,
						whether it be for social reasons,
						education, work, or leisure.
					</p>
					<p>
						In that light, it is more important than ever to consider the design of virtual spaces in
						<b>relation to the human experience</b>. Within virtual environments, traditional architectural
						conceptions of scale, spatiality, movement,
						framing and interaction take on vastly different forms, yet designing virtual space is left
						largely to the purview of software developers, concept artists and game designers. Given the
						<b>increasingly prevalant role of virtual
						environments</b> in our daily lives, as well as the emergence of new technologies such as <b>VR and AR</b>,
						the spatial design of VEs deserves to be <b>examined through an architectural lens</b>.
					</p>

					<p class="quote">
						"Architects need to start thinking about virtual reality as not just a tool, but as
						an end medium in itself." - Brett, 2015

					<h2>Desire for Physicality</h2>
					<p>
						Virtual communication platforms can be assessed on a <b>spectrum of spatiality and modes of
						interaction</b>, from collaborative documents, text chat, virtual whiteboards, voice chat, or video
						chat, to more fully featured environments
						such as 2D, isometric, or 3D game-like simulations, or even fully VR platforms. Especially in
						most of the non-spatial platforms, most would agree that something is lost when transitioning
						from the physical to the virtual.
						Without people and items occupying a physical space, the perception of meetings and events is
						changed. In the digital realm, out of sight often means out of mind.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within these virtual platforms there is an obvious desire for some form of <b>tangibility and sense
						of space</b>. How do we design virtual spaces conducive to interaction that aren't just carbon
						copies of physical space?
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>What are the different rules that govern spatial interaction in virtual environments?</li>

							Can virtual environments take on a less detailed / more abstracted form, yet offer a
							satisfying level of spatial and physical immersion?

					<h2>PLATFORM</h2>
					<p>
						There are two possible mediums for the exploration of virtual environments - a "web app" or
						game-environment operating in <b>2D screen space</b>, or the use of <b>VR technology</b> which immerses the
						user entirely within the 3D space. After some background research and testing, I have decided to with VR despite the
						increased difficulty, due to the much greater potential that the platform offers.

					<h2>PROGRAMME</h2>

						<li>
							<b>Social Function</b> - it is easier to meet and interact when you can understand
							relative positions in space
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>3D Content</b> - interactions with content that are necessarily 3-dimensional, such as
							architectural models, large documents, physical items, museums, etc
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Art and Entertainment</b> - spatial environments are of course important for 3D
							experiences such as games, entertainment, interactive media

					<h3>Educational Focus</h3>
					<p>
						In order to limit the scope of the project and work towards a more defined goal, I have decided to focus on 
						the design of <b>learning environments</b>. That is, any usage which involves <b>multiple actors</b> as well as the need to
						<b>impart knowledge through the use of multimedia</b>. This would target two of the three
						functions of virtual space as outlined above.
					</p>
					<p>
						Such learning environments would include archetypes such as classrooms, lectures, conferences,
						groupwork, study spaces and so on.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>PRECEDENT</h2>
					<p>
						The application of Architecture in virtual environments has been studied since the late 90s with
						the advent of rudimentary 3D graphics.
						However, the virtual world as we now understand it has a clear precursor - Cinema - which
						theorists and filmmakers have already studied in depth since the early 20th Century.
					</p>

					<h3>Architecture and Film</h3>
					<p>
						Cinema as a series of framed experiences - drawing from the heritage of the Greek picturesque in
						Architecture. Every experience within the virtual environment is necessarily framed by the
						boundaries of the screen space, making
						the curation of views and angles even more important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within film as well as virtual environments, spatial perception is bounded by the <b>
							screen
							space
						</b>. It is impossible to 'feel' the space around you without actively looking up or
						around. What are the implications of space-creation under these constraints?
					</p>
					<p>
						Architecture as an <b>inattentive</b> form of viewing, whereas Cinema involves <b>attentive</b>
						viewing. In a way, VEs lie somewhere between the two - there is a conscious attention devoted to
						experiencing the virtual
						environment, yet with enough exposure the environment is likely to fade into the background as
						well.
					</p>

					<h3>Virtual Environment Design</h3>
					<p>
						Virtual environments have in fact been studied for over 20 years, with papers examining the
						various aspects of VE design in early 3D environments. I am currently in the process of conducting exhaustive
						research on the available literature, to see what can be applied to current issues, what
						frameworks can be adapted or referenced, as well as what issues might already have been investigated.

						A virtual environment can through the visual dimension of perception, in
						combination with interactive feedback, be helpful in generating immersiveness, understood as the
						sensation of actually being present in an architectural space. A sensation of being present,
						even while one is maintaining a conscious knowledge that this feeling is only an illusion
						created by a digital model. - Hermund et al. 2018

					<h2>PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION</h2>
					<p>
						The smaller preliminary study aims to investigate the experience of spatiality in virtual reality
						environments. Building upon previous research that has investigated the perception of virtual
						space, this research project will focus on designing for <b>human interaction and learning</b>.  Although there are many possible parameters to explore (as seen below),
						I will be focusing on <b>extracting design principles that govern virtual user interaction</b>. The results of this study
						will form a set of design guidelines for virtual learning spaces which will then be used for the final product.

					<h2>Navigation</h2>
					<p>
						Testing movement from point A to B, or user orientation within complex spaces. How easily can
						users navigate different types of spaces within virtual space?

					<h3>Extra-Diegetic Elements</h3>
					<p>
						In film and game design, diegesis refers to elements that belong to the narrative space such as
						characters, props, set, sound, etc, while extra- or non-diegetic refers to elements which are
						outside of the scene, such as soundtracks, overlays, or interface elements. How useful are
						extra-diegetic cues in the understanding of virtual space? Is it possible to do without them?
					</p>
					<h3>Modes of Movement</h3>
					<p>
						Especially in full VR environments, teleportation is a common method of transportation due to the
						disorientation associated with walking in-game but standing still in real life. What
						implications does this have on the way that we perceive and understand the sequence of spaces?

					<h2>Interaction</h2>

					<h3>Distance between users</h3>
					<p>How does the distance between users affect perception of space and interactions? Does it actually matter given that communication can transcend space? Usually, people prefer to be up close to see facial expressions and hear better, but without such concerns in virtual space, what kind of "personal space" do users require?</p>
					<h3>Medium of interaction</h3>
					<p>Variety of possible modes for interaction - text, voice, other visual cues. Possibility of using spatial features as cues for interaction? E.g. walls block sound, distance modulates sound, line of sight, etc.</p>
					<h3>Navigation between groups</h3>
					<p>Tying in to the above idea of navigation - interactions between various groups can be represented in physical space using overlays, perspectives, or switching between spaces.</p>

						Most VR apps appear to have a richly detailed physical space as an anchor for users, likely to orientate them to the unfamiliar environment in the same way that skeumorphic design serves to acclimatise new digital users.
