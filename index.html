					<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
					<p class="quote">"It is likely that in the near future, a large number of people will be spending a
						considerable amount of time 'inside' such worlds. If we are to live - even partially - 'inside'
						these worlds, we must consider their architecture. The nature of space in VEs, however, is
						fundamentally different from the
						nature of real space and consequently the architecture of VEs will require a new theory and
						practice." - Bourdakis & Charitos, 1999
					</p>

					<h3>Architecture and Virtual Environments</h3>
					<p>Despite the fact that virtual environments (VEs) have been around for more than 20 years and
						there has been continued research into their design and implementation, they have been regarded
						largely as entertainment and as
						accessories to physical interaction. In the midst of the post-digital revolution and the ongoing
						pandemic, we are increasingly looking at VEs as <b>substitutes</b> for real-life interaction,
						whether it be for social reasons,
						education, work, or leisure.</p>
					<p>In that light, it is more important than ever to consider the design of virtual spaces in
						relation to the human experience. Within virtual environments, traditional architectural
						conceptions of scale, spatiality, movement,
						framing and interaction take on vastly different forms, yet designing virtual space is left
						largely to the purview of software developers, concept artists and game designers. Given the
						increasingly prevalant role of virtual
						environments in our daily lives, as well as the emergence of new technologies such as VR and AR,
						the spatial design of VEs deserves to be examined through an architectural lens.</p>

					<p class="quote">"Architects need to start thinking about virtual reality as not just a tool, but as
						an end medium in itself." - Brett, 2015</p>

					<h3>Design for Physicality</h3>
					<p>Virtual communication platforms can be assessed on a spectrum of spatiality and mode of
						interaction, from collaborative documents, text chat, virtual whiteboards, voice chat, or video
						chat, to more fully featured environments
						such as 2D, isometric, or 3D game-like simulations, or even fully VR platforms. Especially in
						most of the non-spatial platforms, most would agree that something is lost when transitioning
						from the physical to the virtual.
						Without people and items occupying a physical space, the perception of meetings and events is
						changed. In the digital realm, out of sight often means out of mind.</p>
					<p>Within these virtual platforms there is an obvious desire for some form of tangibility and sense
						of space. How do we design virtual spaces conducive to interaction that aren't just carbon
						copies of physical space?</p>

					<ol>
						<li>What are the different rules that govern spatial interaction in virtual environments?</li>
						<li>In what ways can we take advantage of virtual platforms to go beyond replicating the
							physical?</li>
						<li>Can virtual environments take on a less detailed / more abstracted form, yet offer a
							satisfying level of spatial and physical immersion?</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>PLATFORM</h2>
					<p>There are two possible mediums for the exploration of virtual environments - a "web app" or
						game-environment operating in 2D screen space, or the use of VR technology which immerses the
						user entirely within the 3D space.</p>

					<h3>Web App</h3>
					<ul class="list-plus">
						<li>Accessible</li>
						<li>Potential for interesting conclusions</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="list-minus">
						<li>Well researched since late 90s</li>
						<li>Confined to screen space, less spatial opportunity</li>
						<li>Possibly becoming less relevant</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
					<ul class="list-plus">
						<li>Newer technology - less well explored</li>
						<li>Spatial implications are much more relevant</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="list-minus">
						<li>Less accessible for presentation</li>
						<li>Harder to test and build environment</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>PROGRAMME</h2>
					<p>At its core, creating a spatial experience in virtual environments is useful in several ways:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Social Function</b> - it is much easier to meet and interact when you can understand
							relative positions in space</li>
						<li><b>3D Content</b> - interactions with content that are necessarily 3-dimensional, such as
							architectural models, large documents, physical items, museums, etc</li>
						<li><b>Art and Entertainment</b> - spatial environments are of course important for 3D
							experiences such as games, entertainment, interactive media</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Of the above 3 functions, Art and Entertainment is a highly subjective field and while it would
						certainly benefit from a more developed spatial vocabulary, the lack of limitations and
						open-ended design goals make it difficult
						to approach as a research topic.</p>
					<p>In terms of spatial design, the social function of virtual spaces seems to be the most essential
						and practical - there are certain frameworks in real-life architecture that we can apply to
						analyse human interactions within
						designed spaces (both human-to-human and human-to-environment interactions).</p>
					<p>Interactions with physical items or resources is an interesting aspect which is not entirely
						architectural yet nevertheless pertinent to any sort of virtual environment. These afford the
						opportunity to design for user
						interaction in a way that complements the spatial configuration.</p>

					<h3>Educational Focus</h3>
					<p>While it was suggested to take a look at designing virtual conferences, with reference to the
						above understanding of virtual space utility, I am thinking it might be better to generalise the
						research domain as "learning
						environments". That is, any usage which involves <b>multiple actors</b> as well as the need to
						<b>impart knowledge through the use of multimedia</b>. This would fulfil two of the three
						functions of virtual space as outlined
						above.</p>
					<p>Such learning environments would include archetypes such as classrooms, lectures, conferences,
						groupwork, study spaces and so on.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>PRECEDENT</h2>
					<p>The application of Architecture in virtual environments has been studied since the late 90s with
						the advent of rudimentary 3D graphics.
						However, the virtual world as we now understand it has a clear precursor - Cinema - which
						theorists and filmmakers have already studied in depth since the early 20th Century.</p>

					<h3>Architecture and Film</h3>
					<p>Cinema as a series of framed experiences - drawing from the heritage of the Greek picturesque in
						Architecture. Every experience within the virtual environment is necessarily framed by the
						boundaries of the screen space, making
						the curation of views and angles even more important.</p>
					<p>Within film as well as virtual environments, spatial perception is bounded by the <b>screen
							space</b>. It is impossible to 'feel' the space around you without actively looking up or
						around. What are the implications of space-creation under these constraints?</p>
					<p>Architecture as an <b>inattentive</b> form of viewing, whereas Cinema involves <b>attentive</b>
						viewing. In a way, VEs lie somewhere between the two - there is a conscious attention devoted to
						experiencing the virtual
						environment, yet with enough exposure the environment is likely to fade into the background as
						well.</p>

					<h3>Virtual Environment Design</h3>
					<p>Virtual environments have in fact been studied for over 20 years, with papers examining the
						various aspects of VE design in early 3D environments. I intend to conduct more exhaustive
						research on the available literature, to see what can be applied to current issues, what
						frameworks can be adapted or referenced, as well as
						what issues might already have been investigated.</p>

					<h2>THESIS OUTCOMES</h2>
					<p>Creation of a platform as well as guidelines for the design of virtual spaces for learning, based
						on gathered research and principles. Ideally the platform would be end-user friendly, drawing on
						some elements of participatory design and UI explored by the others in the studio. This would
						allow educators and amateur event
						organisers a platform to create and customise virtual spaces for learning, while basic users
						have the ability to experience pre-designed spaces for their purpose.</p>

					<h2>CAARDIA Investigation</h2>
					<p class="quote">A virtual environment can through the visual dimension of perception, in
						combination with interactive feedback, be helpful in generating immersiveness, understood as the
						sensation of actually being present in an architectural space. A sensation of being present,
						even while one is maintaining a conscious knowledge that this feeling is only an illusion
						created by a digital model. - Hermund et al. 2018</p>
					<p>The smaller preliminary study aims to investigate the experience of spatiality in virtual reality
						environments. Building upon previous research that has investigated the perception of virtual
						space, this research project will <b></b>identify several design features that impact users'
						perception
						of spatiality</b> and test them in a constructed virtual environment. Metrics will be devised to
						understand user perception and behaviour within these environments to evaluate the implications
						of these design features - if necessary, multiple iterations can be performed to improve upon
						user research. Final paper will present the findings regarding these design features and
						potentially make recommendations about their use and further study.</p>

					<h2>Final Product</h2>
					<p>Ideally, the final thesis outcome will be an interactive platform for learning that allows users
						to construct their own virtual environments, conforming to the principles highlighted by the
						earlier investigations. The use of these constructed environments would range from the temporal
						(meeting rooms) to the semi-permanent (classrooms, museums, conferences).</p>
					<h3>App Flow</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Users choose from a set of pre-made environments or create their own within an intuitive
							front-end editor interface.</li>
						<li>Users 'playtest' their environment to see if it suits their needs - aim for minimal
							playtesting due to intended ease of use and modularity.</li>
						<li>Resulting room is fit for usage by multiple participants.</li>

					<h2>Navigation</h2>
					<p>Testing movement from point A to B, or user orientation within complex spaces. How easily can
						users navigate different types of spaces within virtual space?</p>
					<h3>Extra-Diegetic Elements</h3>
					<p>In film and game design, diegesis refers to elements that belong to the narrative space such as
						characters, props, set, sound, etc, while extra- or non-diegetic refers to elements which are
						outside of the scene, such as soundtracks, overlays, or interface elements. How useful are
						extra-diegetic cues in the understanding of virtual space? Is it possible to do without them?
					</p>
					<h3>Modes of Movement</h3>
					<p>Especially in full VR environments, teleportation is a common method of transportation due to the
						disorientation associated with walking in-game but standing still in real life. What
						implications does this have on the way that we perceive and understand the sequence of spaces?
					</p>
					<p>Difficulty - not sure if some of these variations are surface level - will need to examine
						greater architectural implications in the design of spaces for movement.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Information</h2>
					<p>What aspects of spatial design affect transmission of information? 3D space mainly allows for the layout of information in a spatial manner, making it easier to understand and organise large sets of data.</p>
					<h3>Understanding the potential of spatial information presentation</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Viewing information in screen-space</li>
						<li>Physically-imitative information viewing</li>
						<li>Hybrid viewing - extra-diegetic</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Designing spaces for information viewing</h3>
					<p>How do we design environments where large amounts of information or media can be easily viewed and understood?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="media-section">
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/st-info-1.PNG"></div>
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/st-info-2.PNG"></div>
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/st-info-3.PNG"></div>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Interaction</h2>
					<p>Another major consideration in the design of spaces would be the facilitation of interaction between participants. Again, the conception of what is 'human scale' and distance is uncertain in the virtual environment.</p>
					<h3>Number of users</h3>
					<p>Possibility of rooms and environments to adapt to the number of users in a space, creating different settings for different purposes.</p>
					<h3>Distance between users</h3>
					<p>How does the distance between users affect perception of space and interactions? Does it actually matter given that communication can transcend space? Usually, people prefer to be up close to see facial expressions and hear better, but without such concerns in virtual space, what kind of "personal space" do users require?</p>
					<h3>Medium of interaction</h3>
					<p>Variety of possible modes for interaction - text, voice, other visual cues. Possibility of using spatial features as cues for interaction? E.g. walls block sound, distance modulates sound, line of sight, etc.</p>
					<h3>Navigation between groups</h3>
					<p>Tying in to the above idea of navigation - interactions between various groups can be represented in physical space using overlays, perspectives, or switching between spaces.</p>
